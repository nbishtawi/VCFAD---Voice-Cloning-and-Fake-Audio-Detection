# VCFAD---Voice-Cloning-and-Fake-Audio-Detection
We are a technology company working in the Cyber Security industry. We focus on building systems that help individuals and organizations to have safe and secure digital presence by providing cutting edge technologies to our customers. We create products and services that ensure our customers security using data driven technologies to understand whether audio and video media is authentic or fake.

Our goal in this project is to build algorithms that can synthesize spoken audio by converting a speaker’s voice to another speaker’s voice with the end goal to detect if any spoken audio is pristine or fake.


# Goal(s):

Build a machine learning system to detect if a spoken audio is synthetically generated or not. In order to achieve this, first, build a voice cloning system given a speaker’s spoken audio that clones the source speaker’s voice to the target speaker’s voice. Next, build a machine learning system which detects if any spoken audio is a natural speech or synthetically generated by machine.
